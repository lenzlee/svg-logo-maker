Bootcamp Homework 8: SVG Logo Maker

## Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker
In this project, we were asked to build an SVG Logo Maker where a user answers a series of questions that will then render in the file that is auto generated by this app. The main task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a logo file in SVG format from a user's input using the Inquirer package. In my application, the auto generated logo/SVG file will be created in the root directory. 

I installed the Jest library to test the JavaScript by running *npm install --save-dev jest*. The *shapes.spec.js* file imports the shape classes from the *shapes.js* module and defines the test suite for the shape class. The test checks if each shape object can be displayed correctly by calling the render method and comparing the result to an expected SVG string.

## How to Use this App:
To run the application, the steps are:
1. Run node index.js in your terminal
2. Answer all 4 questions
3. The logo.svg file will be generated

## How to Test this App:
In your terminal, type *npm test*
