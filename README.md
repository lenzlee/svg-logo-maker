Bootcamp Homework 8: SVG Logo Maker

## Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker
In this project, we were asked to build an SVG Logo Maker where a user answers a series of questions that will then render in the file that is auto generated by this app. The main task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a logo file in SVG format from a user's input using the Inquirer package. In my application, the auto generated logo/SVG file will be created in the root directory. 

## How to Use this App:
To run the application, the steps are:
1. Run node index.js in your terminal
2. Answer all the questions
3. The SVG file will be generated
